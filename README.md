Shape-Based Educational Game

 Project Overview
The Shape-Based Game is an interactive educational application developed for students of classes 6 to 12 to help them understand 2D and 3D shapes in a practical and engaging way. The game allows users to click on different shapes and view important properties such as area, perimeter, and volume.

This project focuses on combining learning with programming by implementing all major Core Java and Object-Oriented Programming concepts in a real-world use case.

Objective
- To make learning geometry interactive and fun  
- To help students understand 2D and 3D shapes visually  
- To apply core Java OOP concepts in a practical project  

Key Features
- Interactive shape selection  
- Supports both 2D and 3D shapes  
- Displays area, perimeter, and volume  
- User-friendly interface for students  
- Modular and scalable code structure  
- Educational and beginner-friendly  

 Shapes Implemented
### 2D Shapes
- Circle  
- Rectangle  
- Square  

### 3D Shapes
- Sphere  
- Cube  
- Cylinder  

## Technologies Used
**Core Java**, including:
- Class & Object  
- Constructors  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Method Overloading  
- Method Overriding  
- Upcasting  
- Interface  
- HAS-A Relationship  

OOP Concepts Implementation
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Used to model different shapes with common behavior  
- **Method Overriding:** Applied to calculate area and volume for specific shapes  
- **Method Overloading:** Used for handling different calculation scenarios  
- **Upcasting:** Shape objects are stored in parent class references to demonstrate dynamic method dispatch  
- **HAS-A Relationship:** The Game class contains multiple Shape objects for better modularity  
- **Interface:** Common behaviors like `calculateArea()` and `calculateVolume()` are defined using interfaces
  
 Learning Outcomes
- Strong understanding of Core Java concepts  
- Hands-on experience with Object-Oriented Programming  
- Ability to design modular and extensible applications  
- Experience in building educational software
  
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to blend educational content with strong programming fundamentals. By using Core Java and OOP principles, I created a scalable and maintainable application that promotes interactive learning while reinforcing core software development concepts.
